## Usage/Examples

```python
python main.py
```

## Roadmap

- Test workflow agent.
- Develop machine learning application.
- Train machine learning model using HPC.

## Optimizations

- Attempt to integrate additional worflow agents to debug and test.
- Run the code on a larger scale to test the efficiency of the code.


## FAQ

#### What do I need to run the codes?

Our demo requires running te `main.py` file. This file will read the `json` file which contains the task to be performed.

#### Are these codes compatible with any Python environment?

The code requires `Python 3.9` or higher to run. The code is compatible with any Python environment.
